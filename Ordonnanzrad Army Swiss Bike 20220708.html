Welcome to my personal experience with the "Software Development Basic Learning Journey".<br>

I have never been programming before this Learning Journey - and look, how far I and all other participants all got within a few weeks time. 
I started this learning journey to get an insight into programming. <br><br>
	Why? Because I am a curious person and as our CEO always says: "Everything is software".
	<br>
	
	Although having never coded before, I thought to myself - ok, give it a try. Let´s see, what one can achive with some guidance and a super cool community of learners!</p>
	<br>
	

</div>

<! -- Paragraph including color Tele-Magenta, and size bold and size at the same time --> 

	<p style="font-size:200%; color:#BB3E77 "><strong>Amazing!</strong></p>



<! -- Paragraph normal --> 

	




<! -- Header in style colour green and bold --> 

<H1 >How to insert images from the internet</h1>


<! -- Paragraph normal --> 

	<p> We have learned, how to include an image from an external web location. One can easily see, when hovering over the image, that one can by clicking on the image jump to the external source in the internet.</p>


<! -- Image inserting via an anchor, image embedded from an external web location with description.  --> 

	<a href="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/12/04/14/05/code-1076536_960_720.jpg";  > Example: A licence-free picture "programming" by Pixabay:   <br>
	<br>
	<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/12/04/14/05/code-1076536_960_720.jpg" alt="Pixabay" style="width:150px;height:150px;">  </a>
	<br>
	<br>


<! -- Paragraph normal --> 

<p> We have also learned, that you can either insert an impage from the internet, or save it, e.g. as a jpg-file, and insert it to the page. <br> <br>Please check out this example:
<br>
<br>
The first picture is once again a link to an image in the Internet: You can identify this once again via hovering over the picture, thus having the possibility to jump to this picture.
</p>
<br>


<! -- An image embedded from an external web location  --> 

<a href="http://google.com" > Another example: A licence-free picture "UFO abduction of children´s tricycle" by Pixabay: <br> <br><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/09/16/12/43/ufo-1673929_960_720.jpg"/>  </a>
<br>
<br>


<! -- Paragraph normal --> 

	<p> Now this is the same image, but saved as jpg and inserted into the page. Also the size has been altered. 
	<br>
	If you now hover over the picture, you are not able to jump to the picture itself, just watch it.
	</p>


<! -- Picture saved as jpg, inserted in the website, and also adjusted size of picture  --> 

	<img src="Fahrrad Ufo.jpg" alt="UFO Bike" style="width:400px;height:600px;">

	<H1 >How to insert a table</h1>


<! -- Paragraph --> 

	<p> We have also learned, how to insert a table with different rows and lines. Also, how to change the style, so the frame looks more appealing. </p>


<! -- Header  --> 

	<head>This is my first table</head>
	<br>

<H3>How to insert a button</H3>


<p> Now lets see some Java Script in action, and also insert a button. </p>






<! -- Button HTML without any interaction or function--> 

<button type="button">Click Me!</button>

<br>

<br>
<! -- ONBLUR function.It allows some action to happen when the user clicks away from a form field or other element that they had just previously been in.--> 

<H1 >JAVA Script ONBLUR EVENT Tests. Currently only for field 1 an onblur event has been defined.</h1>
<br>
<p>Currently only for the first two fields some functions have been designed.</p>
<br>
	
	<input id="field1" type="text" onblur="checkField1();"/> <span id="message1"></span>
	<input id="field2" type="text" onblur="checkField2();"/> <span id="message2"></span>
	<input id="field3" type="text"/> <span id="message3"></span>
	

<br>
<br>



<! -- JAVA Script alert test and multiply task. The taks has once again been inserted AFTER the body and before body closes.--> 
<! -- Also, this is an onclick-event, which is needed for the final examination.--> 

<H1>JAVA Script alert test</h1>


<p>Java script alert test and Multiply task. When clicking the "Alert test"-button, then a pop-up openes up with the message "the test worked". Followed by an inserting field, and a mathematical task. </p>

<button onclick="alert('The test worked');">Alert test</button>

<input id="mathInput" type="number"/> <button onclick="myAlertMath()">Multiply x 5</button>

<p id="test"></p>

<br>
<p>Thank you for reviewing my first baby steps in HTML and Java script. 

<br>

It was really fun learning something completely from and by "Scratch" :-)</p>
